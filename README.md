## H2 On-premise GPT2 English demo:
- fine-tune-gpt2-eng.py: This script fine-tunes the lightweight GPT-2 model (distilgpt2) on a custom text dataset (data.txt) using Hugging Face's Transformers on CPU. It tokenizes the data, configures training with the Trainer API, and saves the trained model and tokenizer.
